## Image Compress Application
Link to app: <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/spidartist/app_image_compress/main/compress.py">Click me!</a>

- This app is compress image (yes, it make image lost data, but the image is more lightweight)
- Backgrond: When learn about K-means algorithm in Machine Learning, i want to build an app that use this algorithm

- Work's time: About half month

- With me, this is very meaningful production when i start learn AI/ML

- Technical: Using scikit-learn library's K-means algorithm, process input image using Numpy, OpenCV and at last deploy with Streamlit.
